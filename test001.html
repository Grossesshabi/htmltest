<h1 id="galois-theory-i">Galois Theory I</h1>
<p>Galois theory is an interesting mathematical topic. The theory has a
very elegant structure,  and it is the starting point of many aspects of
modern number theory. However, it looks quite formidable for most
novices who are little trained in professional mathematics.</p>
<p>If so, Is it possible to introduce it to a wider class of audiences
beyond the university students majored in mathematics?</p>
<p>I think the answer should be, ‘YES’, and I even believe that, it is
possible to explain this beautiful theme to high school students, as the
title shows.</p>
<p>In my opinion, although there are many standard textbooks in abstract
algebra and ‘story books’ on Galois theory,  these materials are either
too formal or too sketchy. A concrete introduction to the whole theory
without too much deep concepts is still lacking.  So I just make this
attempt.</p>
<p>       Some Elementary Facts</p>
<p>The general approach to Galois theory is started with some concepts,
such as linear vector spaces, fields, groups. Instead, we’ll start with
some motivating examples which are so elementary that they frequently
appear in your exercise and exams. The only prerequisite is some
acquaintance with elementary arithmetic of rational and complex numbers,
and the $ n$-th root of a number.</p>
<p>First we fix some standard notations. We use $ $ denotes the set of
rational numbers, $ $ the set of integers.</p>
<p>From elementary math we know that thet set of rational numbers $ $ is
closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and taking inverse
(of a non-zero number). Moreover, you should have also done the
following easy calculations: Given two numbers of the form $ a+b,a,b$,
compute the addition, subtraction, and multiplication of these two
numbers.</p>
<p>After doing such kind of computations, it is quite obvious that, the
set of the numbers of the form $ a+b,a,b$ are closed under addition,
subtraction, and multiplication. These are not very surprising
facts.</p>
<p>A less trivial problem is how to take an inverse of a number of this
form? For example, what is the `closed form’ of $ $?</p>
<p> Here `closed’ means that we do not want square roots appear in the
denominator. The solution is given by using the ‘well known formula’: $
(a+b)(a-b)=a<sup>2-b</sup>2$. Multiply $ 1-$ on both numerator and
denominator, we find that:</p>
<p>$ = = =-1+$</p>
<p>It turns out that the result is still of the form $ a+b<span
class="math inline">.<em>A</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>g</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>c</em><em>l</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>t</em>, <em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>n</em><em>u</em><em>m</em><em>b</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>m</em></span>
a+b,a,b$ is closed under the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division (we exclude divided by zero). We use $ []$ to denote the set of
numbers of the form $ a+b,a,b$.</p>
<p>This will lead to the of concept of field. A field is defined to be
an algebraic system $ (F,+,)$, where $ (F,+,0)$ and $ (F-{0},,1)$ are
both Abelian groups, and the distributive law holds.  We have already
seen that $ $ and $ []$ are fields. Although we have not defined what is
a (Abelian) group, the only important thing is that, $ $ and $ []$ are
closed under multiplication and division (not by zero).  This tells that
some properties are preserved by adding $ $ to $ $.</p>
<p>Another key point in our “trick” is that there exits a “symmetry”
behind when adding $ $. We note that the symmetry is given by a map $
$:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">$\sigma:a+b\sqrt{2}\mapsto a-b\sqrt{2},\;
\forall a+b\sqrt{2}\in\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$</span>.</p>
<p>Moreover, by taking the symmetry $ $ two times, we get the identity
map. When we rationalize the denominator of $ $, we actually use this
symmetry, and we see that $ 1-$ is exactly $ (1+)$.</p>
<p>We conclude this first part by observing the following two
interesting fact of $ $. First every operation in $ []$ is ‘preserved’
under this map, that is</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>σ</em>(<em>x</em>+<em>y</em>) = <em>σ</em>(<em>x</em>) + <em>σ</em>(<em>y</em>), <em>σ</em>(<em>x</em><em>y</em>) = <em>σ</em>(<em>x</em>)<em>σ</em>(<em>y</em>)</span>
for any $ x,y[]$.</p>
<p>Another one is the method we use in rationalization: For any $ x$, we
have</p>
<p><span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><em>σ</em>(<em>x</em>) ∈ ℚ</span>.</p>
<p>We will make further discussions for the higher order cases.</p>
